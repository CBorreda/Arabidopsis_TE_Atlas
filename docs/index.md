# The Arabidopsis TE wiki

This wiki contains a summarized version from the datasets produced in by *Borreda et al.*, and it is intended to be a straightforward way for the Arabidopsis TE community to access the cDNA and protein sequences of Arabidopsis transposable elements. An early version of this work [can be found in bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.02.587720v1), while the complete and most updated article is in revision.

## Table of contents

- [Elements](elements/index.md) - List of annotated TE elements, their isoforms, cDNAs and main encoded proteins.
- [Structural similarities](struct_sim/index.md) - UMAP of structural similarities of TE proteins and cellular genes.
- [Interaction potential](interacts/index.md) - Interaction network based on AlphaFold2 iPTM metric between TE proteins and cellular proteins.
