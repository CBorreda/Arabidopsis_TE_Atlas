# Structural similarities

By performing FoldSeek, we found significant structural similarities between Arabidopsis TE proteins and Arabidopsis cellular (regular) genes found in UniProtKB. These results can be explored in the following UMAP. Genes (in grey) appearing nearby TE protein clusters (in different colors) are structurally similar and might therefore have a related origin / function.
