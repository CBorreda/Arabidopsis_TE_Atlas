# Interaction potential

Using AlphaFold2, we calculated the structure of >60000 potential dimers between TE proteins and nuclear cellular proteins. Using a set of known interacting protein paris, we stablished a iPTM threshold of 0.42 as the one providing a 95% specificity. Here we show the interacting network between TE proteins and cellular proteins, selecting only those interactions above the threshold.
